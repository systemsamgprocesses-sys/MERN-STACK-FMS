## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **A. Data Structure Requirements** 📊

**1. Extend User Model** (Currently missing phone numbers)
```javascript
// Add to User schema:
phoneNumber: {
  type: String,
  // E.164 format: +91XXXXXXXXXX or +1XXXXXXXXXX
}
whatsappNotifications: {
  enabled: Boolean,
  verifiedAt: Date
}
```

**2. Extend Task Model** (To track notifications sent)
```javascript
// Add to Task schema:
whatsappNotifications: {
  createdNotificationSent: Boolean,
  createdNotificationTime: Date,
  statusChangeNotificationsSent: [{
    status: String,
    sentAt: Date,
    recipient: ObjectId
  }],
  completionNotificationSent: Boolean
}
```

**3. Create Notification Log** (For audit trail)
```javascript
WhatsAppNotificationLog = {
  messageId: String,
  recipient: ObjectId (User),
  event: String (created/completed/overdue),
  taskId: ObjectId,
  message: String,
  status: String (sent/failed/pending),
  sentAt: Date,
  deliveredAt: Date,
  readAt: Date
}
```

---

### **B. WhatsApp Providers** 📲

**Best Options:**
1. **Twilio WhatsApp API** ⭐ (Recommended)
   - Easiest integration
   - Good documentation
   - Affordable
   - Setup: `npm install twilio`

2. **MessageBird**
   - Similar to Twilio
   - Setup: `npm install messagebird`

3. **WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta)**
   - More complex setup
   - Official WhatsApp channel
   - Lower costs at scale

4. **Ultramsg**
   - Simple webhook-based
   - Less expensive
   - Good for small teams

### **D. File Structure for WhatsApp Service** 📁

```
server/
├── services/
│   ├── whatsappService.js           ← Core WhatsApp logic
│   ├── notificationQueue.js         ← Queue management (optional)
│   └── messageTemplates.js          ← Message formatting
├── routes/
│   ├── tasks.js                     ← Hook into task creation
│   ├── objections.js                ← Hook into objections
│   └── projects.js                  ← Hook into project events

### **E. Event-Driven Architecture** 🔄

```javascript
// In task creation route:
try {
  const task = await Task.save();
  
  // Emit event (non-blocking)
  eventEmitter.emit('task:created', {
    taskId: task._id,
    assignedTo: task.assignedTo,
    title: task.title,
    dueDate: task.dueDate
  });
  
  res.json(task);
} catch(err) {
  res.status(500).json(err);
}

// Elsewhere - Listen to event:
eventEmitter.on('task:created', async (data) => {
  await whatsappService.sendTaskCreatedNotification(data);
});
```

### **F. Where Each Integration Point Goes** 🎯

| Event | File | Line | Hook Type |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| Task Created | `tasks.js` | After line 408 (task.save()) | After Save |
| Task Completed | `tasks.js` | After line 505 (status=completed) | After Status Update |
| Task Overdue | Create cron job | - | Scheduled Job |
| Status Changed | `tasks.js` | Line 134-159 | After Update |
| Objection Created | `objections.js` | After creation | After Save |
| Objection Resolved | `objections.js` | After line 104 | After Approval |
| FMS Project Created | `projects.js` | After project creation | After Save |
| FMS Step Triggered | `projects.js` | When prev step done | On Trigger |

### **5. Error Handling** ⚠️
- Invalid phone numbers
- User not on WhatsApp
- Network failures
- Provider API down

### **6. Notification Preferences** ⚙️
```javascript
User can customize:
├─ Which events trigger notifications
├─ Quiet hours (don't send 9 PM - 8 AM)
├─ Batch notifications (hourly digest)
├─ Urgency levels (only high priority)
└─ Disable for specific task types
```
