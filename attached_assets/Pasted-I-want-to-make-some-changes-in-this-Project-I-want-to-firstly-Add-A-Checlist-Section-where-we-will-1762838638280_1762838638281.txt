I want to make some changes in this Project,
I want to firstly Add A Checlist Section, where we will make CheclistsRealted tasks, and this will be a seperate section only.
Here we will give option ot create checklists
Checklists can have multiple items
and it (checklist) can be created for Daily, weekly, fortnighlt, and monthly as well and also we will give customised interval it can be any months or weekl or days.

Once the clecklist is created it can Submitted without chcking all the checkboxed and the same progress will refect on its dashboard, create a seperate dasboard for the Checklists section.

The Checlists structure will be
A Parent name
Sub Parent (child of the parent) and then Its chlids ass well.

Example : Main task
Has 2 tasks
And both Tasks have 3 checklists each
task 1 is 100% complete, mens the 3 checklists are done.
and the task 2 is 67% done, means only 2 checklist are done.

and then calcute the progress of the Main Task.

Task modification, missed to mark as completed, or check for any other cased , and this will show to the Super Admin only
and he will close them by adding remarks to them.
